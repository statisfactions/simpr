Patch release of package simpr, now 0.2.4.  This fixes R CMD check warnings in CRAN version simpr 0.2.3: https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_simpr.html

## R CMD check results
R CMD check run on Ubuntu, Mac OSX, and Windows (via win-builder). There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There is one NOTE:
