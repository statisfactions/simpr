Patch release of package simpr, now 0.2.5.  This fixes R CMD check error in CRAN version simpr 0.2.4 (issues with oversensitive package tests failing on Linux systems) that resulted in the package's archival from CRAN on 2023-03-31.

## R CMD check results
R CMD check run on Ubuntu, Mac OSX, and Windows (via win-builder). There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There is one NOTE ("New submission" and noting the package's archival from CRAN).
